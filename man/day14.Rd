\details{
\strong{Part One}

The incredible pressures at this depth are starting to put a strain on
your submarine. The submarine has
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization}{polymerization} equipment
that would produce suitable materials to reinforce the submarine, and
the nearby volcanically-active caves should even have the necessary
input elements in sufficient quantities.

The submarine manual contains [instructions]{title="HO

HO -> OH"} for finding the optimal polymer formula; specifically, it
offers a \emph{polymer template} and a list of \emph{pair insertion} rules (your
puzzle input). You just need to work out what polymer would result after
repeating the pair insertion process a few times.

For example:\preformatted{NNCB

CH -> B
HH -> N
CB -> H
NH -> C
HB -> C
HC -> B
HN -> C
NN -> C
BH -> H
NC -> B
NB -> B
BN -> B
BB -> N
BC -> B
CC -> N
CN -> C
}

The first line is the \emph{polymer template} - this is the starting point of
the process.

The following section defines the \emph{pair insertion} rules. A rule like
\code{AB -> C} means that when elements \code{A} and \code{B} are immediately adjacent,
element \code{C} should be inserted between them. These insertions all happen
simultaneously.

So, starting with the polymer template \code{NNCB}, the first step
simultaneously considers all three pairs:
\itemize{
\item The first pair (\code{NN}) matches the rule \code{NN -> C}, so element \code{C} is
inserted between the first \code{N} and the second \code{N}.
\item The second pair (\code{NC}) matches the rule \code{NC -> B}, so element \code{B} is
inserted between the \code{N} and the \code{C}.
\item The third pair (\code{CB}) matches the rule \code{CB -> H}, so element \code{H} is
inserted between the \code{C} and the \code{B}.
}

Note that these pairs overlap: the second element of one pair is the
first element of the next pair. Also, because all pairs are considered
simultaneously, inserted elements are not considered to be part of a
pair until the next step.

After the first step of this process, the polymer becomes \code{NCNBCHB}.

Here are the results of a few steps using the above rules:\preformatted{Template:     NNCB
After step 1: NCNBCHB
After step 2: NBCCNBBBCBHCB
After step 3: NBBBCNCCNBBNBNBBCHBHHBCHB
After step 4: NBBNBNBBCCNBCNCCNBBNBBNBBBNBBNBBCBHCBHHNHCBBCBHCB
}

This polymer grows quickly. After step 5, it has length 97; After step
10, it has length 3073. After step 10, \code{B} occurs 1749 times, \code{C} occurs
298 times, \code{H} occurs 161 times, and \code{N} occurs 865 times; taking the
quantity of the most common element (\code{B}, 1749) and subtracting the
quantity of the least common element (\code{H}, 161) produces
\code{1749 - 161 = 1588}.

Apply 10 steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the
most and least common elements in the result. \emph{What do you get if you
take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity
of the least common element?}

\strong{Part Two}

The resulting polymer isn\'t nearly strong enough to reinforce the
submarine. You\'ll need to run more steps of the pair insertion process;
a total of \emph{40 steps} should do it.

In the above example, the most common element is \code{B} (occurring
\code{2192039569602} times) and the least common element is \code{H} (occurring
\code{3849876073} times); subtracting these produces \code{2188189693529}.

Apply \emph{40} steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the
most and least common elements in the result. \emph{What do you get if you
take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity
of the least common element?}
